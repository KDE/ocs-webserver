      <p><h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p>Contributors to any part of the Opendesktop platform get a compensation each time their contribution/product is downloaded. Download-clicks are converted into monetary value based on the following terms:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Payout = Number of Downloads * Pling-Factor * 1 $-cent,</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>where each product category is valued by a so-called “Pling-Factor”.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You can see the value of each category in the list below.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Based on the actual amount of content and downloads, we may adjust these values at any time, even during a month.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Payouts are voluntary and we reserve the right to cancel any single product or payout or all payouts without any reason.</p>
        <p></p>
        <!--<p>We are currently evaluating using Bitcoin as a payout method in the future.-->
        <p>Any product to be paid out requires a libre license. Certain products also require a link to the online source repository (see list below), like e.g. cgit.kde.org or github. This is different from just providing the source-code, but to provide an easy setup for collaboration and transparent changes.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In order to receive any payouts, you need to provide a valid PayPal option under your OpenDesktop account settings.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We hope this form of compensation values those who put time and effort into creating free and open source software & content and leads to an ever increase of quality and sustainability.        </p>
