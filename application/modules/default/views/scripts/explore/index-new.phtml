Download the package\r\n2. Open a terminal\r\n3. Go to the directory where the file has been downloaded\r\n3. Execute the following commands by replacing *filename* with the actual downloaded filename:\r\n\r\n    $ chmod +x *filename*.AppImage\r\n    $ .\/*filename*.AppImage --install\r\n\r\nProper installation is recommended to register the app in the desktop menu and make it check for

decentralized censorship-resistant network. Users can publish static or dynamic websites into ZeroNet and visitors can choose to also serve the website. Websites will remain online even if it is being served by only one peer. When a site is updated by its owner, all nodes serving that site (previous visitors) will receive only the incremental updates done to the site content. ZeroNet comes with a built-in SQL database. This makes content-heavy site development easy. The DB is also synced with hosting nodes with incremental updates.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n    We believe in open, free, and uncensored communication.\r\n    No censorship: After something is published there is no way to remove it.\r\n    No single point of failure: Content remains online even if only one peer is serving it.\r\n    Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere. Content is served by any user who wishes to.\r\n    Fast: ZeroNet uses BitTorrent technology to deliver content faster than centralised servers.\r\n    Works offline: You can access the site even if your internet is unavailable.\r\n    Secure: Content ownership is secured using the same cryptography that secures your Bitcoin wallet.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n    Easy, zero configuration setup.\r\n    Password-less BIP32 based authorization: Your account is protected by the same cryptography as your Bitcoin wallet.\r\n    Real-time updated sites.\r\n    Namecoin .bit domains support.\r\n    SQL Database support: Allows for easier site development and faster page load times.\r\n    Anonymity: Full Tor network support with .onion hidden services instead of ipv4 addresses\r\n    TLS encrypted connections.\r\n    Automatic, uPnP port opening.\r\n    Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support.\r\n    Works with any browser\/OS.","version":"git.bf042ce","project_license_id":null,"image_big":null,"image_small":"1\/4\/a\/4\/9705784fc20d54fcbbd2204f049b05da8b57.jpg","start_date":null,"content_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-08 06:11:46","changed_at":"2017-05-08 06:12:04","deleted_at":null,"creator_id":"444759","facebook_code":"","source_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/HelloZeroNet\/ZeroNet","twitter_code":"","google_code":"","link_1":"https:\/\/zeronet.io\/","embed_code":"","ppload_collection_id":"1494238322","validated":"0","validated_at":null,"featured":"0","ghns_excluded":"0","amount":"35","amount_period":null,"claimable":null,"claimed_by_member":null,"count_likes":"0","count_dislikes":"0","count_comments":null,"count_downloads_hive":"0","source_id":"0","source_pk":null,"source_type":null,"project_validated":"0","project_uuid":"5ad7e9803e1b44a58d6c3daa7462364e","project_status":"100","project_created_at":"2017-05-08 06:11:46","project_changed_at":"2017-05-08 06:12:04","laplace_score":"50","member_type":"0","project_member_id":"444759","username":"probonopd","profile_image_url":"https:\/\/cn.pling.com\/cache\/200x200-2\/img\/a\/c\/8\/8\/e8b3de4c4faa5738d1f7afd68e7dabeb3fbe.png","city":null,"country":null,"member_created_at":"2016-09-09 19:07:27","paypal_mail":"mail@simon-peter.de","cat_title":"Network","cat_xdg_type":"bin","cat_name_legacy":"","cat_show_description":"1","amount_received":null,"count_plings":null,"count_plingers":null,"latest_pling":null,"amount_reports":null,"package_types":"381","package_names":"AppImage","tags":"app,software,appimage","count_downloads_quarter":"35","project_license_title":null,"category_title":"Network"},{"project_id":"1126893","member_id":"13015","content_type":"text","project_category_id":"239","hive_category_id":"223","status":"100","uuid":"2b8ac7ce82de48eea1e2d1cda6f86e5c","pid":null,"type_id":"1","title":"digiKam","description":"digiKam is an advanced digital [b]photo management application[\/b], which makes importing and organizing digital photos a \"snap\". The photos can be organized in albums which can be sorted chronologically, by directory layout or by custom collections.\r\n\r\nTired of the directory constraints? Don\u2019t worry, digiKam also provides [b]tagging functionality[\/b]. You tag your images which can be spread out across multiple folders and digiKam provides fast and intuitive ways to browse these tagged images. You can also add [b]comments and rating[\/b] to your images. digiKam makes use of a fast and robust database to store these meta-informations which makes adding and editing of comments and tags very reliable.\r\n\r\nAn easy to use interface is provided that enables you to [b]connect to your camera[\/b] and preview, download and\/or delete your images. digiKam includes too an image editor for image corrections and manipulations.  \r\n\r\nAnother tool, which most artists and photographers will be familiar with, is a [b]Light Table[\/b]. This tool assists artists and photographers with reviewing their work ensuring only the highest quality. A light table will show the artist their imperfections in which they can go and touch up. Well in digiKam, the light table function provides the user a similar experience. You can import a photo, drag it onto the light table, and touch up only the areas that need it.\r\n\r\nThe digiKam [b]Image Editor[\/b] come with some common tools e.g. red eye correction or colors correction. Additional tools are provided with the main application to process advanced corrections on image like color management, noise reduction, or special effects. digiKam Image Editor support all camera RAW file formats, 16 bits color depth, Exif\/Makernote\/IPTC\/GPS metadata, Color management, tagging\/rating\/comments pictures, etc.\r\n\r\nA lots of search tools are also available to be able to find specific photo on whole collection : [b]Time line[\/b], Calendar, Advanced Search using multiple and complex database queries (tags, rating, keywords, date, location, camera, shot settings, etc.)\r\n\r\nA stand-alone image editor version named [b]Showfoto[\/b] is also available. It runs without digiKam images database support, but provides all Image Editor tools.\r\n\r\nSee the related project page for more information:  \r\n\r\n[url]http:\/\/www.digikam.org[\/url]\r\n\r\nOnline documentations:  \r\n\r\n[url]http:\/\/docs.kde.org\/development\/en\/extragear-graphics\/digikam\/index.html[\/url]\r\n[url]http:\/\/docs.kde.org\/development\/en\/extragear-graphics\/showfoto\/index.html[\/url]\r\n\r\nNOTE:  \r\n\r\n- Please, use the digiKam mailing-list for all comments: \r\n\r\n[b]digikam-users at kde dot org[\/b]\r\n\r\n- Please, use Bug Tracking System for wishes and reports:\r\n [url]http:\/\/bugs.kde.org\/buglist.cgi?product=digikam[\/url]\r\n\r\nYou can contact developers on Freenode IRC channels:\r\n\r\n[b]#digikam[\/b]\r\n\r\nor using the developers mailing-list :\r\n\r\n[b]digikam-devel at kde dot org[\/b]\r\n\r\nTo help digiKam project, you can [u]donate money to developers[\/u].
