                    <li>Creative individuals can use the Network to capture other people’s interest and draw attention to the products or services they offer. The creators (hereinafter called "Makers") of such products/services (hereinafter called "Products") can present their work via opendesktop.org.</li>
                    <li>Products shall be deemed to include digital work, such as videos, music, software, applications or graphics, etc.</li>
                    <li>Visitors to the Network (hereinafter called "Consumers") can view, listen to, use or download the products etc., while the Makers can stipulate what scope will be accorded to the Users.</li>
                    <li>Instead of being loaded on to the Network or stored at opendesktop.org, the Products will only be inserted from an outside source by the Makers themselves.</li>

            <br>
            <div class="term-description"><ol>
                    <li>Registration on opendesktop.org website is free of charge</li>
                    <li>These Terms of Use apply for all Users who have registered with the Network. Registration will be deemed valid if a User has conducted the registration process properly and has provided accurate particulars in full before clicking on "Register".</li>
                    <li>No General Terms and Conditions on the part of the User or any other Conditions that deviate from or contradict these Terms shall be applicable.</li>
                    <li>Users may not provide any registration data (member’s name, profile image) that is vulgar or offensive to others, nor are they permitted to impersonate other individuals or create a false identity (through the use of a celebrity or company name).</li>
                    <li>When registering on the opendesktop.org Network, Users are obliged to complete all the fields on the registration form truthfully and correctly. Registration is only possible when all the compulsory fields have been filled in.</li>
                    <li>Users may not take any action that might place an unreasonable or excessive burden on opendesktop.org, the Network and the facilities provided by opendesktop.org.</li>
                    <li>Users may only register on the Network with one user account at a time. If a User loses his/her registration data, he/she undertakes to contact opendesktop.org without delay.</li>
                    <li>Users should add opendesktop.org’s email addresses to the Safe Senders List, for instance, to ensure that emails with the domain ending "@opendesktop.org" are not mistakenly marked as spam.</li>
                    <li>The purpose of entering the email address on the registration form is to allow opendesktop.org to identify the Users and get in touch with them. opendesktop.org is entitled to send Users messages pertaining to technical matters, the operation and the functions of the facilities provided. To this end, Users must ensure that their email address is always kept up-to-date. If opendesktop.org is unable to contact a User at the email address in opendesktop.org’s database and the fault lies with the User (out-of-date address, failure to check his/her inbox, etc.), any disadvantages resulting thereof will be interpreted to the detriment of the User, i.e. the email will be deemed delivered.</li>
                    <li>When registering, Users have to choose a password with which to log on to the Network using their member name. Users undertake to change their password at regular intervals and to employ passwords of an appropriate length (8 alphanumeric characters consisting of both letters and numbers). The password may not be passed on to third parties.</li>
                    <li>It is not permitted to sell or transfer the members account to any third parties. The same applies to other persons using a member’s account.</li>

            <br>
            <div class="term-description"><br><br><ol>
                    <li>Makers are themselves responsible for the contents they offer. This applies to all legal matters relating to the Product. In this connection we draw particular attention to intellectual property and trademark rights (this list is not exhaustive).</li>
                    <li>In so far as opendesktop.org provides assistance with the promotion of Products, this is done under exclusion of any liability.</li>
                    <li>Makers who insert their own contributions on the Network (uploads, embedding, framing, etc.), declare that neither the contents nor the Products breach any existing laws or violate common standards of decency. In particular, the Makers give their assurance that they are entitled to use and disseminate the contents of the Products, that the Products are not offensive and are suitable to be viewed by individuals of all age groups. The Makers are entirely responsible for checking the relevant legal regulations (copyright and proprietary rights, trademark rights, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Makers shall indemnify opendesktop.org against any claims lodged by other Makers, Consumers or third parties on the alleged grounds that Products or contents posted on opendesktop.org infringe certain rights. Indemnity also covers the necessary financial outlay involved in opendesktop.org’s legal defence including all court costs and lawyers’ fees at the statutory rate.</li>
                    <li>In addition, the Makers are obliged to support opendesktop.org in the event of any action brought by third parties, other Makers or Consumers by providing all the information etc. required for investigating the claims and setting up the defence &ndash; in full, truthfully and promptly.</li>

                    <li>Granting these rights does not enable opendesktop.org to appropriate the Makers‘ contents in the context of any liability standards but serves merely to simplify the administrative work and the implementation of the contents when operating the Network or promoting the Products.</li>
